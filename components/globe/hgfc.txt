the arcs are the lines that are curved and move from one point in the globe to the next point from the imported json data.When i initially mount the globe by fully reloading the page it is on the globe loads correctly.When i navigate to a different page prop and come back to the pageProp with the globe, its like the timeout is not being reset.Context my website has 5 pages all of which can be accessed as component and do not require full page reload during navigation...more context, here is my _app.jsx: import { AnimatePresence, motion } from "framer-motion";
import { useRouter } from "next/router";

import Layout from "../components/Layout";
import Transition from "../components/Transition";

import "../styles/globals.css";

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
    const router = useRouter();

    return (
        <Layout>
            <AnimatePresence mode="wait">
                <motion.div key={router.route} className="h-full">
                    <Transition />
                    <Component {...pageProps} />
                </motion.div>
            </AnimatePresence>
        </Layout>
    );
}

export default MyApp;
